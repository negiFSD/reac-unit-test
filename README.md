* Jest is a testing framework that finds tests, runs the tests, determine whether the test passed or
  failed and reports it back in human readbale manner

* RTL is a testing utility that provides virtual dom for testing react components 

* There are three types of test
    - Unit test: Testing indibidual building blocks of an application ex class or functional component.
    - Integration test: contains multiple unit test or components
    - E2E test: Testing the entire application flow and ensuring it work as designed from start to 
      finish

* Test Driven Devlopment(TDD) or Red-Green testing
    -Test driven devlopment is a software devlopment process where you write tests before writing the software code
    -once the test have benn written, you then writ the code to ensure the tests pass

* In testing we dont focus on how code is implementing rather we focus what should be the output 

* We can have multiple insertion in one test function i.e multiple variables and expecters

* We should use same htmlFor with label and and id with input to interconnect them
